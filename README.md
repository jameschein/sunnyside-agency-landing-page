## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

A deep dive into SASS for this project and a more careful html structuring to boot.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

A deeper dive into both CSS and JS Animation to come.
