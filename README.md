## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS custom properties
- Semantic HTML5

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I keep putting off a deeper dive into CSS animation. With this challenge complete on the surface I may indeed return to implement more animation aspects.

### Useful resources
